# Hi üëã, my name is Pedro Borges


#### I hold a BSc in Informatics and Computing Engineering and am currently pursuing my MSc in the same field. My passion for technology and computing started at a young age, and over the years, I have explored a wide range of technologies ‚Äî from mobile app development with Flutter, Unity, Firebase, and Vuforia, to front-end and back-end web development and database management. I enjoy solving complex problems, continuously learning new tools and frameworks, and applying innovative solutions to real-world challenges.
